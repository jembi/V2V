BSIS
====

BSIS (Blood Safety Information System) was a project started at Georgia Institute of Technology as part of the [Computing For Good (C4G)](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/about/advancing/c4g/) Program at Georgia Tech, under the name V2V (Vein to Vein). The project is now maintained by [Jembi Health Systems](http://www.jembi.org) in South Africa.

# Background
BSIS is a software to manage blood related information from the point of donation through testing, storage to its eventual usage in a hospital or a clinic. Handling of blood is a sensitive operation and record of movement of blood as it goes through the following chain is critical to the effective functioning of blood processing centers. This solution is primary targeted for deployment in the developing countries of Africa where much of the blood inventory tracking is done on paper.

The software was developed at Georgia Tech as part of the C4G program in collaboration with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Safe Blood for Africa (SBFA) and the participating countries of Africa, and is now developed and maintained by Jembi Health Systems (JHS) in South Africa.

## Problems related to blood supply in Africa
* Unsafe blood can lead to disease transmissions
* Insufficient supply of Safe Blood in hospitals point-of-care
* Higher number of individuals living with HIV in Africa
* Shortage of blood
* Many countries of Africa depend on paper based systems to track the movement of blood through the blood processing chain

[This factsheet] (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs279/en/index.html) from WHO discusses the problems related to blood safety and availability specifically the developing countries of Africa in greater detail.

## Challenges
 * Transitioning from a paper based system to a computer based system can take time and experience
 * Varying blood processing practices across different countries
 * Unreliable Internet connectivity
 * Developing intuitive and easy-to-use admin. Cannot depend on an onsite admin to configure databases.

## Solution
The challenges listed above have influenced the design of BSIS and the following design features have resulted.
 * Develop a browser based but locally deployable solution to avoid dependence on Internet
 * Smaller upgrade package size to allow 
 * Make features configurable so that blood processing centers can turn them on/off based on their current practice
 * A single installer which installs and configures all dependencies like Java, MySQL, Apache Tomcat etc. to make first time configuration simple.

Many other design decisions in the future will be influenced by the same parameters.


Development Environment
-----------------------
1. This repository contains some Eclipse specific configuration. If you are comfortable using Eclipse then setting up your development environment will be relatively easier.
   You may use another IDE if you wish to.
    * Download and unpack Eclipse Indigo 3.7 or Eclipse Juno 4.2 from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.
    * Install Apache Tomcat 7 and integrate with Eclipse (you may follow http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/tomcat-7-with-eclipse.html).
    * Clone the master branch into a local directory preferably housed in your eclipse workspace.
    * The project dependencies are configured using [Maven] (http://maven.apache.org/). Install Eclipse plugin [m2eclipse] (http://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html) for easier integration of Maven with your development environment. In Eclipse, select Help>Install New Software and add the site http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases to add the m2eclipse plugin.Setup m2eclipse so that it automatically downloads all the required dependencies, sources, javadocs.
    * Import the source code into Eclipse by using 'Import Existing project' option. The master branch contains the required eclipse project files (e.g. .project and .settings), so you should be able to start working right away. For other IDE's you will need to more work.
2. You will also need to setup a MySQL database:
    *  Run the Maven build `mvn clean install` which will call the liquibase scripts to create and initialise your database.
    * `BSIS/src/database.properties` contains your database connection information.

Important Coding Conventions
----------------------------
  * Use 2 spaces instead of tabs to indent your code. 
  * Use the appropriate [codestyles](codestyles) template for your IDE. These codestyles are based on the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
  * Only auto format the code you are working on.

Git Commit Messages
-------------------
Use the supplied Git commit message template to ensure that commit messages conform to the project standards. The first line of
the commit message should contain a JIRA ticket reference and a short description of the commit (50 characters max). The following
lines (72 characters max) should describe why the changes is being made, what the problem was and contain external references.

In your BSIS Git repository folder, run the following command:

```
git config commit.template .git.template
```

This will set the git commit template for the local git repository only. If you'd like to set the template for all your Git 
repositories, then run the following command:

```
git config --global commit.template .git.template
```
